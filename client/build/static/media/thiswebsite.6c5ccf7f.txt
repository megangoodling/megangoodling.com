This is my personal website that I built up pretty much from scratch! (Although we all stand on the shoulders of giants... thanks @Facebook for making React.) I use a MERN tech stack (that is, MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). I use Craco for aliasing, ESLint for linting, and Enzyme and Jest for testing. I use the atomic structure for my React components and Heroku to deploy. It was super fun to make. Check out the codebase here: https://github.com/megangoodling/megangoodling.com.
