In 2018, I started a small laser-cut jewelry business in the Davidson College Maker Space. My driving aims were 1) be resourceful and sustainable with the tools provided to me by Davidson, 2) solve the market whitespace problem that is a lack of very cheap jewelry, and 3) get some small-scale experience with entrepreneurship and marketing.
