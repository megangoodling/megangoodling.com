My first 6 weeks of working at ThoughtWorks were spent at ThoughtWorks University (TWU) in Pune, Maharashtra, India. It was a very cool, immersive experience simulating a client experience that we might work on at ThoughtWorks. We learned practices such as agile software development, test driven development, consulting skills, among many other things. Plus, TWU attendees get to meet ThoguhtWorkers from all around the world!
