I participated in a social justice project for ThoughtWorks with Rashin Fahandej, a talented artist out of Boston. Her goal was to create a site to record and visualize the stories of incarcerated individuals and those affected by their incarceration, in order to highlight racial and socioeconomic inequality within the justice system.
