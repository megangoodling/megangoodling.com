I spent the summer of 2017 working in the Natural Language Processing Lab within the Computer Science Department of Columbia University. I worked under Dr. Kathleen McKeown in her research analyzing Twitter Data from a violent gang in Chicago. The research goals were to use Machine Learning to identify patterns within the Twitter dataset which could help predict when violence might occur within the community.
