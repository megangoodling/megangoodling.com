In 2017, I got super bored and, with inspiration from Andy Baay, spent my time in the Davidson College Maker Space creating a "smart" mirror with an old computer monitor, a double sided mirror, a Raspberry Pi computer, and some help from Physical Plant to create a wooden frame. I exhibited it at the Digital Studies Showcase. The mirror showed real-time time and weather and was very complimentary of those who looked in it :).
